I am creating a IIoT dashboard for my company called "Forge".

This app will show visualizations of data collected from a factory floor. These data will be collected from a variety of sources, including:
- Sensors
- PLCs
- Cobots
- Other factory equipment

This directory is a Next.js app with a shadcn/ui design system.
The design system is already configured.

Use your frontend design skills to create a complete dashboard with charts and graphs.

In the current stage, there are four metrics displayed on the dashboard. (/dashboard).
I want these metrics instead:
1. Uptime
2. Production Rate
3. Quality
4. Efficiency

I need pages for different metrics.
- /dashbaord is for overall metrics and summaries.
- /robot is for cobot metrics.
- /sensors is for sensor metrics.
- /plc is for PLC metrics.

Current use dummy data for the charts and graphs.
